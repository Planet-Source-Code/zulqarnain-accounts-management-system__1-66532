This is my first posting on PSC.

I had to make a project on Accounts Management. I tried to find out examples over the internet but all the efforts were in vain. I couldn't find one (neither on PSC or A1VbCode or FrreeVbCode etc) which fulfil my needs.
I decided to start on my own and eventually with in 15 hours I was able to develop this software.

This code will teach about basic Accounting Terminologies and calculations that takes place.
This code will also teach to use Data-Reports without Data Environment.

I haven't made any Update or Delete panel.
If you want to enter data from scratch do the following steps:
1. Go to tbl_balancesheet, and update dr and cr fields to 0 explicitly
2. Go to tbl_incomestatement. and update drcr field to 0.
3. Go to tbl_acc_period_transaction and delete the record (if any).
All entries will automatically be deleted from other tables as they are inter-linked.

I am willing to increase this software more that would have all 8-Steps of Accounting Cycle in it which will include:
User Login
User Groups (Client/Server Architecture)
Complete Accounting Cycle with closing.
Update, Delete and Searhcing Features.
More Accounting Reports.
Etc.

But I need your feedback, comments on it.
Please post your feedbacks, comments, questions, queries, errors if found etc.
If you have any query abt Accouting Calculations let me know.....
And plz do RATE it.
